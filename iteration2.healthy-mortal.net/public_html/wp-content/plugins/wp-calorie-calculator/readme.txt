This plugin is weight management made simple. Whether you are launching a WordPress website to help others achieve their desired body mass or working on your own shape and fitness, the WP Calorie Calculator plugin is what you’re looking for.

Having a calorie calculator on your website is an absolute must if your business is in the nutrition and fitness sector. Your clients will most definitely enjoy the opportunity to monitor and manage their daily calorie norms and body mass with the help of your website. Make your service catchy!

<h3><strong>A GREAT TIME-SAVER</strong></h3>
So many factors affect our energy consumption needs that estimating the necessary calorie intake in mind would be too complicated. You end up wasting half of your day doing lots of math with your calories, weight and height and comparing target body mass to your current weight.</br>
No one wants to spend their life on endless calculations! Let your visitors delegate that tedious work to our WordPress Calorie Calculator plugin. Install it and make your website attract even more sports and weight management strivers.

<h3><strong>SCIENCE BEHIND THE CALORIES</strong></h3>
BMR, or basal metabolic rate, is one of the most widely used parameters for finding out the preferred calorie ratio. For our calculator plugin, we use the Mifflin – St. Jeor formula. It identifies BMR by analyzing the essential features of your organism: body mass, height, age and biological gender. Each of those numbers is multiplied by a special index, and, as a result, the daily calorie consumption rate is calculated. The formula also takes sports and other types of activity into account: this way, the users can be sure that the calorie norm offered by WP Calorie Calculator corresponds with their individual physical characteristics such as weight, height and others.

<h3><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></h3>
Our Calorie Calculator for WordPress gives you the shortcode that you can place onto a page, in a post or a sidebar. Put it anywhere it suits the most to catch the attention of your visitors!</br>
Once you have the plugin installed, you get a neatly designed WordPress page with a few input fields for age, body mass, and height, gender selector, and measure units toggle. It is followed by a selection of lifestyles where users tick the one that fits them best. The dropdown menu on the bottom provides possible body mass goals: weight maintenance, loss or gain (and the speed of the process).

Once a user puts all the parameters in the corresponding boxes, the calculator solves the equation. WP Calorie Calculator works with both metric and imperial units to ensure convenience for everyone all over the world. Switching from one system or another on the way is also not a problem – the plugin converts everything automatically. Try it: after typing all the data, click on the units toggle to set it to the desired units – boom, done! No need to rack your brain over converting heights and weights.</br>

This built-in calculator will, without a doubt, be a most-liked feature on your website – people will hardly manage to resist the urge to check out their daily calorie norm set up in accordance with their body mass goals.

It runs as you go: if you select an instant view, WordPress Calorie Calculator demonstrates the results straight after everything is typed. No need to click on any additional buttons – our calculator plugin is made as user-friendly as possible.

<h3><strong>MAKE IT UNIQUE</strong></h3>
The plugin allows changing the main colors so that they fit in your website design. In this version, there are only 2 types of colors - primary and secondary - that are changeable. The <a href="https://wpcaloriecalculator.com/">Pro version</a> provides much more flexibility and lets you define the color of almost any detail on the screen, from the title to the on-hover color.

You can also choose how results will be delivered to your visitor – directly in the form or via email. When the first option is selected, the calorie amount is displayed immediately once all the necessary input has been submitted. The latter can help a great deal in email marketing - to make the work on that easier, we added Mailchimp integration in the <a href="https://wpcaloriecalculator.com/">Calculator Pro</a>.

<h3><strong>PRO EDITION</strong></h3>
Of course, the standard version of the WP Calorie Calculator plugin has sufficient functionality to improve the user experience of your site's customers. However, for those who think that the basic list of the calorie calculator features is not enough, our plugin has a Pro version. Its functionality can be described in three blocks: advanced features, extra integration and ease of configuration.
